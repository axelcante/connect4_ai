# connect4_ai

A study of different tree search techniques based on a Connect4 game (using Python)

A very simple/messy implementation of both a Monte Carlo Tree Search and Minmax algorithms playing Connect4 against one-another.

This is my very first time using Python - apologies for the poor code optimisation.

To run this Python program I used Anaconda/pygame. You can download the scripts and run it yourself!

It requires no user inputs; player one (MCTS) plays against player two (Minmax) infinitely.
